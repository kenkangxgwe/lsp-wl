  diagnostics reporting rules.

## [0.3.0] - 2021-01-26 üß®üêÇ

### Added

- Support for debugger adapter. Code can be evaluated and symbols can be
shown in the editor.

the help with testing)

## [0.2.2] - 2020-08-01 üê±‚Äçüèç

### Added

- SignatureHelp is available for functions when `[` and `,` is input.

### Changed

- Change the dependencies from `AST` and `Lint` to `CodeParser` and
`CodeInspector`.
- The alias completion has been improved by reducing the number of
`completionItem`s, and returning `\`-prefixed aliases when triggered twice.

### Fixed

- `triggerCharacters` should be a list (thanks to
[@dalanicolai](https://github.com/dalanicolai)).
- The `duplicate requests`
error will not popup in Output window in VSCode (reported by
[@GiovanniBordiga](https://github.com/GiovanniBordiga)).
- MessageName should be shown when hovered

## [0.2.1] - 2020-01-24 üèÆüêÄ

### Added

### Changed

- The Top-level function / list declaration is visible in documentSymbol.
- Attributes and Option are showed in hover messages.
- Operators will also trigger the hover messages.

### Fixed

- Mathematica before version 11.3 are correctly using the StringRepeat.

### Known issues

- The hovering could be triggered, when cursor is in side a parent syntax
  node even it is not on the operator/function head. Not sure about the UX.
- Color-related requests are slowed down intentionally, since it is in low
  use frequency comparing to messages like didChange and completion.
- Even if some requests are prioritized to improve the experience, sometimes
  responds could still be slower if the document is changing too frequent.

### Added

- Auto check for upgrades and dependencies.

### Changed

- Using Brenton's `Lint` package to diagnose the document.
- Documentations now have a better format with code block (in hovers and completions).
- Diagnostics are published schedulely.

### Fixed
